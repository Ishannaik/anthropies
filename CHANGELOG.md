# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Layer A strips `Made-with: Cursor` and other known-agent trailers (Aider, Amp, Gemini, …). Human GitHub `users.noreply.github.com` co-authors are no longer stripped.
- `init-rewrite` wizard and `~/.anthropies/config.json` fallback for humanize rewrite settings (PR #8). Env vars still win. Default remains `print-prompt`.

## 1.0.0 DarioCyclovir — 2026-08-23

First production release.

Package, CLI, and plugin version is `1.0.0`. HTTP `GET /health` and `GET /capabilities` keep JSON `version` `"0.3.0"`. Kernel API is `1.0.0`. Sidecar protocol is `1.0.0`. Default Compose image tag remains `anthropies:0.3.0`.

- Detector packs: Gemini SynthID adapter and official detector adapter
- Rewrite-stylometry pack with loopback rewrite adapters

- Compose profiles for optional packs
- Compatibility matrix in `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`

### Honesty

This release does not prove the official Claude text detector will fail. It does not prove text is human-written. Absence of a mark does not prove Claude was uninvolved. There is no HTTP `/humanize`. Detection is not a clean certificate.
